# JHU-PULLER

This is a HTML/JavaScript widget I built into the Octagon, my high-school newspaper, website (in WordPress).
It pulls Sacramento County's COVID-19 case and death numbers, as well as US and global numbers, from Johns Hopkins' COVID dashboard GitHub repo, which is updated daily.

To use, simply paste in the HTML code into a custom HTML widget block in whichever website builder you are using. Minify if you like. You can also change it from Sacramento County by finding the FIPS code for your county and replacing that variable in the code.

Happy working!
